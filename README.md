## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
As seen in the screen shot below, the ground_clearance and vehicle_length provided non-random variance to mpg. The vehicle_weight provided a variance that is not significant. The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because the p-value of the hypothesis test was 5.35e-11. The r-squared value is 0.7149, meaning that the multiple linear regression model does an adequate job of predicting the mpg correctly (71% of the time). There are likely other more impactul variables and factors not captured in the dataset that contribute to the mpg variability.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
As evidenced in the screen shots below, Lot 1 & Lot 2 are both within design specifications and have the same mean & median values. Lot 3, however, has far more variance with a calculated value of ~170 that exceeds manufacturing specs. If all three lots are combined and summarized on a total basis, the overall calculated variance is within specifications (~62).
