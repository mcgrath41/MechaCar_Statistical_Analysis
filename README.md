## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
As seen in the screen shot below, the ground_clearance and vehicle_length provided non-random variance to mpg. The vehicle_weight provided a variance that is not significant. The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because the p-value of the hypothesis test was 5.35e-11. The r-squared value is 0.7149, meaning that the multiple linear regression model does an adequate job of predicting the mpg correctly (71% of the time). There are likely other more impactul variables and factors not captured in the dataset that contribute to the mpg variability.

Across the suspension coil manufacturing lots, Lot 1 and Lot 2 are both within design specifications, and both have the same calculated mean and median. However, Lot 3 is far more variable than the other manufacturing lots. Lot 3 has a calculated variance that exceeds the manufacturing specs. If we combine all three lots and look at the total data, the overall calculated variance is within specifications.
